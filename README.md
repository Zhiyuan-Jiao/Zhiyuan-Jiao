### Hi there 👋

I'm Zhiyuan Jiao. I'm a full stack developer with a passion for diving deep into the world of healthcare integration. Currently rocking the role of a healthcare integration specialist/programmer at Noritsu. 
🚀 My coding journey takes a scenic route through geospatial database design and modeling—because who doesn't love a good map, right? 
🗺️ Let's connect, code, and explore the fascinating realm of geoinformation together!
